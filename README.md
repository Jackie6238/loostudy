# loostudy
This is a personal archive of some study material I am making along my journey as a Uwaterloo CS student. (*^â–½^*)

I am trying to post only original (legal) work here. But if any document is even slightly illegal, please contact me and I will take it down ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤

I built (or am building) this website to 

(1) record my painful (happy) univeristy journey

(2) review the HTML, CSS, JavaScript I learnt a million years ago in highschool

(3) start a side project so that my resume is not totally blank (preparing for my first coop)

(4) make your life less painful (I put this one just to make me seem considerate ðŸ‘€)


Here I would like to thank James Ah Yong for inspiration. 

James's CS/BBA University Work saves my life with the solutions he posted for MATH135 when proofs were beating the young and innocent me. 

Though this is not even remotely close to what he has built (https://agony.retrocraft.ca/), his website gave me the desire to share my immature work. 


I hope we can all graduate. Cheers!
